My name is Paul Hill, I completed a PhD in Physics 3 years ago but have decided to change career from academia to the world of coding. I have recently completed some personal Python scripting projects as well as completing the textbook Python Crash Course blah. Right now I am in the middle of a Docker and Kubernetes course on Udemy.
